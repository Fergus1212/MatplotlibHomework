## Overall Summary/Findings
First there is a strong correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight (pearson 0.84). Secondly Capomulin and Ramicane performed very well in the trials. Neither drug had any outliers, and thier average tumor size was over 10mm3 smaller than the other drugs. This was due to a low variance, possibly indicating a very reliable formula. Finally, there may be some cause for concern, as there are an uneven number of data points for each drug trial in this data set.
